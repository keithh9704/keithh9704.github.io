            <h1 class="margin text-center">11th Grade Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>Context: This year's freedom project is a year long project using javascript and a third party javascript tool to make anything the person desires. I decided to create a platformer with a JS tool called kaboom that is fond of making platformers. I also decided to create this platformer that gives the user a sense of nostalgia that reminds them of their childhood.</p>

            <p>Challenge: When learning my JS tool,Kaboom, I would always use the website's playground to experiment and learn how this and that code works. Eventually I realized I would have to transition my learning of kaboom code into github/IDE because I would be creating my freedom project on my IDE. As soon as I transitioned to my IDE and typed in code that would load the sprites, the levels, player movements, and etc. The game would load but nothing would appear and It would just be a blank screen with nothing on it. I even would check the console to pinpoint what lines have an error but the lines will errors didn't have anything wrong with it. I went through the resources of learning kaboom and noticed that commas are needed when making multiple sprites, levels, codes in a function and many more. After I fixed these errors My game was fully functional. </p>

            <p>Takeaways: A takeaway I had from this project was to minimize the amount of commits I have only fixing 1 to 2 lines of code then have a big commit of my feature and fixing errors. Another takeaway I also had from this project is reading carefully what does this bracket, parentheses, commas, etc, do so my code doesn't break completely and I have to find out from all the lines of code what error do I have.</p>

            <p>Next Steps: Going to APCSA I heard that My next freedom project is more on my choices on what I want to make. Also In APCSA the class will go deeply into what javascript can do with a lot of self learning which may be challenging but I am up for the challenge. Hearing these things makes me pretty excited about what next year has in store for me.

            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p> For this project me and my partner combined our html and css knowledge to make a fake movie preview website called Path to the Unknown</p>
            <p> Context: This fake movie is inspired by pokemon and like how the main character would collect little companions/pokemon. 
                Instead of the main character collecting little companions/pokemon the main character would get offered to explore an unexplored region that no one explored 
                since there was a scary big boss on the other side with a map of the unexplored region. Will the main character make it out alive and defeat the boss or fail to defeat the boss with the unexplored region. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Reflection: Making this fake movie preview was easier than I expected but some challenges I came across was actually making what was the movie about because me and my partner aren't that creative. 
                We thought and my partner brought up my idea that I made up for the do now that day and we just made this project off of my idea. Another challenge was finding a copyright free image that fits with the topic of the movie.
                Me and my partner were looking through image after image and searched up different terms that mean the same thing and we finally got two images that look alike and are related to the topic of the movie. 
                The Last challenge I had was centering the image that makes all the devices see that the images are in the middle, not a little bit to the left or right. 
                I quickly learned that we would learn this method in advanced web designing (unit 3) and was given how to center the image that makes all devices see that the image is in the middle.
                Takeaways: Next time Me and my partner would try to make the website more eye-catching since our website is really simple and not interesting at all. We had some cool things we added but we definitely could've added more.

            <p> Content: This project was a year-long project about making a website about a topic's past, modern, and future. My topic was animation and to make my website I used HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Aframe, and blender. I used html and css I learned this year and had to learn Aframe and Blender all by myself. Aframe is a 360-degree image software while Blender makes models for a 360-degree image. Bootstrap helped me create my website more interactive with the viewer that is viewing my website. </p>


            <p> Challenge: While making my website I would make one part of the website have two things side by side. Such as my ideas of what future innovation is and which innovation I choose as my prototype for my website. When I would use columns to make my ideas of future innovation and my prototype side by side, each section would be on top of each other and looked ugly. I struggled many times and finally got it to work with the help of friends. Although I still had problems with sizing and giving those sections some space, those were easy problems to fix.  </p>


            <p>Takeaways: One takeaway I have for this project is that when you find yourself having a problem and are on the verge of giving up don't give up because the feeling when you solve a problem with help from your friend or yourself makes you think that "I am so smart" for solving the problem.  </p>


            <p>Next Steps: Going to sep11 I will be learning a lot of JavaScript and making our own video games, which seems really fun. If I had a chance to do this project again I would put more effort into this project and review things that I made and learned over the whole year since I changed my plan on how to approach this project as I was starting to make the website which is bad since I did a lot of extra work I didn't have to because I made a plan earlier in the year. </p>

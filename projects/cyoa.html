                <p>Me and my partner learned about how make one file go to another file</p>
                <p>Context: We learned about how to make a clickable link on a file which would send you to another file so we did a project to practice what we learned about linking files. We also learned how to communicate since the only way to do a great job on the project is commuting with your partner. When you communicate with your partner you will have a really good plan and a really good idea on which part each of us should do. You can also suggest ideas to your partner that could make the project better. The most important part of commutating is for your partner to tell you to git pull so no merge conflicts would happen and no errors would appear that could be really painful to fix.  </p>
               <p>Challenge: The only challenge me and my partner had was to link a file that was outside of the current sub-directory to a file that was at another sub-directory. First I thought maybe you have to do some weird symbol to directly get to that file. My partner stepped in and said maybe try to use .. like how you cd out of a folder in the terminal using cd .. I tried that and tried to put the file name after the slash but It gave me an error. When i got the error a thought came into my mind and maybe I have to get into the sub-directory first then put the file name I want the link to go to. At first it didn't work so I was really puzzled then I realized I misspelled the file name and got the link to work how I wanted it to work. </p>
               <p>Next Steps: If I were to do this project again I would have liked to be a bit more creative with the topic than just making the topic a life simulator. If I had more time I would make a poor side of the life simulator because in the cyoa me and my partner made, We only made being born into a rich family. Overall the main takeaway is that communication is key in group projects like these.</p>
